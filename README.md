# DamageForge
A League of Legends DPS calculator application that uses Items stats API to pull data and manipulate it to display the DPS against the target enemy.

The Main purpose of the App is to visibly see damage differences based on the tankyness of the opponent, and the build chosen.
This helps clarify when certain items are good to build.

To test the App, feel free to download the APK onto an Android device, install it, and run it.
Otherwise the code files may also be downloaded, opened in Android Studio, and ran from there onto an emulated device.
Main Activities of the code can be found at the following directory:
app/src/main/java/com/example/damageforge

The Main "Build" screen showcases basic functionality, and can Save/Delete Builds created.

The Second "Compare" screen utilizes the saved builds to highlight which build does more Damage Per Second.

The Third "Puzzle" screen generates 2 random builds, and it is your job to figure out which one does more DPS. Pick an option, then check your results!
